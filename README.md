# Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Project Overview

This Customer Satisfaction Analysis project aims to evaluate customer feedback and identify key factors driving both satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

The dataset is sourced from a customer satisfaction survey conducted at Kashmir Caf√©, focusing on the quality of service provided through food delivery. The analysis seeks to uncover insights that can guide strategic decisions to improve customer satisfaction, optimize delivery processes, and enhance overall service quality.

This analysis emphasizes four main areas of customer feedback: Delivery Experience, Food Quality, Delivery Speed, and Order Accuracy.
